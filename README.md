# Alden Weaver's Curriculum Vitae




## About
Alden Weaver's CV, created using Angular 8 & NodeJS.  

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

The meat of the project is adapted from this tutorial that I completed: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-6-for-beginners-by-harsha/learn/lecture/11222494#overview.

The front-end is adapted from the following project:

## Development server

First, run npm install. Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
